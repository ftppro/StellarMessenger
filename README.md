# Stellar Messenger
Send **164 text characters** in one Stellar transaction, for just **.051 XLM** (about **1 cent**). This website uses the **Stellar Smart SDK** (described below), which can be used to create **Shopping Carts**, **Tweets**, and **Discussion Forums** on the Stellar blockchain.

Previously, the **Memo** field was the only way to include text with your payment. The Memo field only allows 32 characters per transaction, so it would take 6 transactions to send 164 characters. It takes 6 seconds to send each transaction to the Stellar blockchain, so it would take 42 seconds to do what this website does in just 1 second. This website uses **micro-payments** to send the text (this is described below).

### Use on Test Network or Main Network:
The checkbox on the upper-left conrer of the page lets you Use the **Test Network**, which is free to use. Hwoever, the **Test Network** can be ten times slower than the **Main Network**, because it often requires multiple **retries** to send a transaction. When using the **Main Network**. I have not encountered ***any*** retries. 

This website allows up to 20 retries for a transaction to be sent. On the **Test Network**, the most retries I encountered is **6**, which took about 60 seconds to send one transaction.

The transaction fee to send text on the **Main Network** is only $0.000001 per character, so you can send 16k of text (100 messages with 164 characters each) for a fee of just 2 cents.
