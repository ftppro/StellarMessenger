# Stellar Messenger
Send **164 text characters** in one Stellar transaction, for just **.051 XLM** (about **1 cent**). This website uses the **Stellar Smart SDK** (described below), which can be used to create **Shopping Carts**, **Tweets**, and **Discussion Forums** on the Stellar blockchain.

Previously, the **Memo** field was the only way to include text with your payment. The Memo field only allows 32 characters per transaction, so it would take 6 transactions to send 164 characters. It takes 6 seconds to send each transaction to the Stellar blockchain, so it would take 42 seconds to do what this website does in just 1 second.
